Bob Kristoff I. Corre

Hello! My name is Bob Kristoff Corre and I live here in the Philippines. I'm currently studying at Ateneo De Naga University, and I hope to become an Architect one day. I'm really passionate about designs and art, and I'm always looking for new ways to learn and improve my skills. 



Moreover about me is that, I spend most of my free time in playing basketball with my brother, friends and cousins. Also, reading is not my interest, but If I were to read about something, it would be about action.



Furthermore, I usually watch NBA highlights in my free time and among all the NBA games, the 2016 finals is my favorite:
